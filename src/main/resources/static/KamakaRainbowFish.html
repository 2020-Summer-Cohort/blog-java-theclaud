            The Kamaka Rainbow fish are known for their impecable, colorful pattern on it's scales. 
            With many hints of blue, from sky blue to turqouise, it's blinding colors will leave you in awe.
             I love watching them swim around during golden hour when their vibrant colors show off the most.
             Preferably kept in schools with other rainbow fish, in warm temperature water.
